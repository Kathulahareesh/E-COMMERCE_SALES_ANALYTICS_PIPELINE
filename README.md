Project Title:
E-commerce Sales Analytics Pipeline
Project Description:
Ingest e-commerce transaction data from CSV files stored in AWS S3, clean and transform it, and load into Delta Lake tables in Unity Catalog for sales analytics and reporting. Common elements include daily batch processing, error handling, data quality checks, and Git integration for version control.
•	Source: CSV files from the Kaggle dataset “E-commerce Dataset” in s3://bucket/raw/ecommerce_sales/YYYY/MM/DD/, containing order details, product categories, customer data, etc.

•	Destination:
–	Bronze: ecommerce_catalog.raw.order_transactions (raw data).

–	Silver: ecommerce_catalog.processed.orders_cleaned (cleaned and standardized data).

–	Gold: ecommerce_catalog.analytics.sales_metrics (aggregated metrics like revenue, order count).

•	Transformations: Parse CSVs, deduplicate orders, standardize formats (e.g., dates, currencies), join with dimension tables (e.g., products, customers), compute metrics (e.g., daily revenue, customer lifetime value), enrich with external data (e.g., promotions), etc.

•	Schedule: Daily batch job at 3 AM UTC using Databricks Workflows.

•	Alerts: Notify via email for data anomalies, log errors to ecommerce_catalog.logs.etl_errors, etc.

•	Technical Specifications:
–	Databricks Workspace: Standard cluster, autoscaling (4–16 workers), m5.large nodes, libraries like pyspark, delta-spark, boto3, etc.

–	Pipeline Tasks:
6.	Data Ingestion: Read CSVs from S3, infer schema, handle malformed records, partition by year/month, etc.

7.	Data Cleansing & Transformation: Deduplicate, standardize data, join with dimensions, apply custom logic (e.g., promotion flags), etc.

8.	Data Write: Write to Bronze, upsert to Silver, create aggregated Gold tables, optimize and vacuum periodically, etc.

9.	Error Handling: Log errors, set up alerts for quality issues, etc.

10.	Orchestration: Use Databricks Workflows, AWS CodeCommit integration, etc.

–	Testing: Unit tests for key logic, validate counts and schemas, test with Kaggle sample data, QA sign-off, etc.
Objective:
Process e-commerce data to enable sales analytics and optimize marketing strategies.
Tools Used:
Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake, AWS S3, boto3, pytest, etc.
Outcomes (Aligned with Data Engineering Standards):
- Scalable Data Pipeline: A robust pipeline using Delta Lake and S3 for scalable analytics.
- Data Quality Assurance: Ensures reliable data with error logging and anomaly detection.
- Performance Optimization: Leverages partitioning and Delta optimizations for efficient processing.
- Version Control and Collaboration: Git integration supports reproducible workflows.
- Business Impact: Enhances sales insights, improving revenue by optimizing promotions.
